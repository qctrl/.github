# Contributing

## Overview

This guide to contributing to [Q-CTRL](https://q-ctrl.com/) projects is intended for all contributors—from external open source developers, to outside collaborators and, of course, members of the [@qctrl](https://github.com/qctrl) team.

When contributing to Q-CTRL projects, always bear in mind that Q-CTRL values the [Three Virtues](https://thethreevirtues.com/).

As a contributor, you agree to abide by the terms of the projects specific license and our [code of conduct](https://github.com/qctrl/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this section are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

1. In the repository navigation, click "Issues".
1. Click "New issue".
1. Choose "Bug report" to create a report to help us improve or "Feature request" to suggest an idea for the project.
1. Use the provided template to create your issue.

More information on [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

## Submitting a pull request

To a submit a pull request to one of the Q-CTRL GitHub repositories:

1. Fork and/or clone the repository.
1. Follow the installation instructions in the README.
1. Create a new branch.
1. Make your changes.
1. Push your changes and submit a pull request.
1. Ensure a pull request title follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard and uses one of the [supported pull request types](#supported-pull-request-types).
1. Address any reviews.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted/approved:

- Follow the [coding standards](https://code.q-ctrl.com/).
- Write tests and make sure they **all** pass (for example `pytest`).
- Lint your code using the file supplied in the project (for example `pylint directoryname --rcfile=.pylintrc`).
- Keep your change as focused as possible (if there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, submit them as separate pull requests).
- Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

After a pull request has been approved, if you squash merge it, its commit message to the `master` branch MUST follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard. Since GitHub defaults a squashed commit message to a pull request title, a title MUST also follow that standard.

Note that:

- We prefer squash merges from short-lived branches (for example `feature/ABC-123`) to long-lived branches (for example `master`).
- If you're a member of the Q-CTRL team, you're responsible for merging your own pull requests once reviewed and approved.
- The following table (whose two left columns are extracted from [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/blob/c936401be64dfc82b2efb69e4e17060f4c9cc3a3/%40commitlint/config-conventional/index.js#L39) ) is a guide on how to choose a proper type for your pull requests/commit messages. The two columns on the right provide guidance on the type of release a commit triggers (major has precedence over minor, which has precendence over patch), and which [section of the release notes](https://code.q-ctrl.com/releases#description) each change should go in.

For `revert` commits, the type of release it leads to and the release notes section in which it is included depend on both the type of the reverted commit and whether it has been released.
If the reverted commit hasn't been released yet (that is, it would be in the same release notes as the `revert` commit), then neither of the commits should be advertised in the release notes.
Note that this might change the type of release, for instance, if the reverted commit was the only new feature or only breaking change in the release.
If the reverted commit has already been included in a previous release, then the reverting commit should be classified on its own merit depending on its changes. 
For example, if the reverted commit added a feature, the reverting commit would be a breaking change (leading to a major release);
if the reverted commit removed a feature, the reverting commit would be adding a new feature (leading to a minor release);
and if the reverted commit wasn't advertised in its release notes, then the reverting commit shouldn't be advertised either.
