# Contributing

This guide to contributing to [Q-CTRL](https://q-ctrl.com/) projects is intended for all contributors - from external open source developers, to outside collaborators and, of course, members of the [@qctrl](https://github.com/qctrl) team.

As a contributor, you agree to abide by the terms of the projects specific license and our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Submitting an issue

To submit an issue against one of the Q-CTRL GitHub repositories:

1. In the repository navigation, click "Issues".
1. Click "New issue".
1. Choose "Bug report" to create a report to help us improve or "Feature request" to suggest an idea for the project.
1. Use the provided template to create your issue.

For more information on submitting issues, see the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue).

## Submitting a pull request

To a submit a pull request to one of the Q-CTRL GitHub repositories:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
1. Configure and install any dependencies.
1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine.
1. Create a new branch.
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards).
- Write tests and make sure they **all** pass (for example `pytest`).
- Lint your code using the file supplied in the project (for example `pylint directoryname --rcfile=.pylintrc`).
- Keep your change as focused as possible (if there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, submit them as separate pull requests).
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Note that:

- We prefer squash merges from short-lived branches (for example `feature/ABC-123`) to long-lived branches (for example `master`).
- If a project has both `development` and `master` branches, we prefer the default merge commit option for merges between them.
- When squashing commits, lines that add little meaning to the overall commit message (for example "Oops missed another instance") should be removed.

### More information on pull requests

See the following resources for more information about pull requests:

- [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)
- [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## Documentation standards

Q-CTRL projects have two types of documentation:

1. [Contributor documentation](#contributor-documentation)
1. [User documentation](#user-documentation)

### Contributor documentation

Contributor documentation is found in the README file and contains only the necessary information for a developer to get started contributing to the project. Q-CTRL follows the standard specified in the [Formatting your README](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/#Formatting-a-readme) GitHub guide. The README file in the [Q-CTRL template repository](https://github.com/qctrl/template) contains the prescribed structure and instructions on how to apply this standard.

### User documentation

User documentation is found on the [Q-CTRL Documentation](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/) website. Any means by which a user accesses the platform is supported by user documentation with the aim of making it easy and intuitive to use the software.

### More information on documentation standards

## Licensing standards

Q-CTRL projects have one of three types of licensing applied:

1. Commercial
1. Open source
1. Unlicensed

## Coding standards

When contributing code, bear in mind that Q-CTRL values the [Three Virtues](http://threevirtues.com/). Standards for coding style SHOULD be obtained from the following hierarchy in the order specified:

1. [Third-party](#third-party)
1. [Language](#language)
1. [First-party](#first-party)

### Third-party

"Third-party" refers to the third-party software you are using and the corresponding [Third-party standards](#third-party-standards). For example, if you are using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), you MUST use the [Django coding style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/). If any of the following conditions hold then you MUST move to [Language](#language):

1. You are not using third-party software.
1. The third-party software does not specify a coding standard.
1. The coding standard does not specify a rule (for example how to name variables).

### Language

"Language" refers to the language you are using and the corresponding [language standards](#language-standards). For example, if you are using [Python](https://www.python.org/), you MUST use the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). If any of the following conditions hold then you MUST move to [First-party](#first-party):

1. The language does not specify a coding standard.
1. The coding standard does not specify a rule (for example how to name variables).

### First-party

"First-party" refers to the [Q-CTRL coding standards](#q-ctrl-coding-standards). The Q-CTRL coding standards exist to specify standards that are not defined in the coding standards of the third-party software or language you are using.

## Third-party standards

| Third-party | Style                                                                                                          | Docstrings                                                        | Testing                       | Linting                           |

## Q-CTRL coding standards

### Variable naming

Unless prescribed otherwise by the framework or language (as described above), use the following rules when naming variables:

- Spell variable names out in full using American English spelling (for example `optimized_pulse` or `optimizedPulse` and **NOT** `op`).
- For variable names that are more than three words, use an acronym (for example `cpmg` and **NOT** `carr_purcell_meiboom_gill` or `carrPurcellMeiboomGill`).
- For variable names that describe how many of an object there are, use `<object>_count` or `<object>Count` (for example `pulse_count` or `pulseCount` and **NOT** `number_of_pulses`, `numberOfPulses`, `pulses_count`, or `pulsesCount`).

### numpydoc docstrings

The [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) standard is unopinionated and/or inconsistent in a small number of cases. We therefore adopt the following additional standards:

- Place the leading and final triple quotes of each docstring on their own lines, with no blank lines separating them from the contents, as follows:
  ```
  """
  <contents>
  """
  ```
- Use single backticks when referring to a module, function, class, method, parameter, variable, or attribute thereof; otherwise use double backticks (for example `` `np.array` ``, `` `int` ``, `` `parameter_1` ``, `` `CustomClass.attribute` ``, `` `CustomClass.method` ``, ` ``value_1*value_2`` `, ` ``function().result`` `, or ` ``List[int]`` `).

## Naming conventions

Use the following rules when choosing names for repositories and packages:

- **Repository** specifies the framework or language (in that order).
- **Install** implies the language (for example `pip` implies Python, `npm` implies JavaScript, `gem` implies Ruby, and similarly for other languages).
- **Import** MAY negates the `-` (for example see [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code: Package and Module Names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names)).
